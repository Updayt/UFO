# UFO Sightings

## Project Overview
Develop a webpage to provide an analysis on UFO sightings throughout the United States. Added filters to allow for multiple criteria searches and find certain data points users acquire for. 
## Resources
Software: Java Script, HTML, CSS, BootStrap

## Results
When the website application is first opened, you will be brought to the web application home page.

Web Application:

![page_layout]( https://github.com/NickFoley47/UFOs/blob/main/static/Images/page_layout.PNG)

The user can filter the UFO sightings by Date, City, Country, and Shape to find certain data the user is looking for. 

Filter Table:

For example, if the user would like to filter for 1/10/2010 and being in Texas. The user will type in the Date filter “1/10/2010” and in the State filter type in “tx”.

Filter based on State and Date:

The user can change filters by deleting their old filters information and filling out any other filters they would like on their next search. 

Filter based on Shape and Date:

## Summary 

Drawback of updated webpage: 
-	The filters are very strict. If a user types in “Tx” or “TX” the filter will not be applied for Texas. The filter must match the data point exactly the way it is displayed. This applies for all filters, which means the user must be careful with what they input 

Recommendations:
-	Allow user input to be more relaxed to allow for filters not have to have precise data match. For example, the filter will recognize “ca”  as “Ca” or “CA”. This will allow for more user-friendly input.  
-	Another recommendation would be adding any pictures that these sightings may have, it will allow for the user to interact with the webpage more and compare their sightings if they have had any.
